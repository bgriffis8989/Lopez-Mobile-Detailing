    <p id="coatP">If you want to protect your investment this is the absolute best way to do it!!
         coatings have been around for some time now and there are so many with false claims. 
         Our coatings we use are so eco friendly for application purposes and they will out last and out shine any competitors. 
         Everyone has different budgets so LMD offeres different coatings.
          Not every one can afford "the best of the best" and that's ok we also offer payment plans to help out our customers in protecting their investment. 
          Ceramic Coatings are products formulated with propriety modified silica. These coatings help with increasing the paint resistance against scratches, marring and dullness.
            The hardness of the coating protects the paint with a much slower degradation during daily use, thus protecting the artistic results from having paint correction performed. A ceramic coating is highly recommended if you plan on getting any machine polishing or paint correction done. </p>
